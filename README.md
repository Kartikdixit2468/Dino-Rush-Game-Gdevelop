# Dino-Rush-Game-Gdevelop
This is a 2D Dino game, which I have made using the GDevelope game engine.

## Game Setup 
1 - Extract the "Assets - 1" folder and copy the folder named "assets" from it.
2 - Paste the folder at the same location where "Dino World.json" is present.
3 - Now Extract all 3 remaining asset folders and copy all the assets(.png, .mp3,.web, etc.) from them.
4 - Paste all the assets at the same location where "Dino World.json" is present.
5 - Now open the Dino "World.json" file in the GDevelope game engine.

## Development under progress...
